    <h1>Git Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Git is a version control system that allows you to manage and keep track
      of your source code history. It is a distributed version control system
      which means that the code is not just stored on a central server, but in
      the distributed server. It is designed to handle everything from small to
      very large projects with speed and efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Git is a free and open source software that is available for all major
      operating systems, including Linux, Mac, and Windows. It is a very
      powerful tool that is used by many developers to maintain their source
      code.
